# Yana v1.0.10

## Minor changes
* App notifications (such as the one notifying you about this update) are not shown as often anymore.
* Upgraded atlaskit dependencies.
* Workspaces can now be reordered and renamed. When starting Yana, the first Workspace in the list will always be selected.
* Re-added text-justification button in note editor.
* When creating a new note from the sidebar, it is automatically opened after naming.

## Bug Fixes
* Workspaces with the same names can cause issues. This is now enforced.
* When a workspace could not be loaded, Yana suggests opening a different workspace instead of completely crashing.
* Creating hyperlinks in notes via the url-button now works again.
